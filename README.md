Nest Labs Embedded Runtime (NLER)
=================================

# Introduction

NLER is designed to supply the minimal building blocks necessary to create event passing 
applications in deeply embedded environments.

NLER provides abstractions for:

* atomic operations
* (event) queues
* locks
* logging
* semaphores
* threads
* timers

NLER currently supports the above abstractions against the following build platforms:

* FreeRTOS
* Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR)
* POSIX Threads (pthreads)
